I earned a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University at Buffalo (aka UB, SUNY at
Buffalo, and etc.)](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu), researching distributed and mobile systems under
supervision of Prof. Steven Y. Ko. During my PhD study, I had also worked with Prof. Oliver Kennedy

Even earlier in my life, I was a master student at Seoul National University and I worked for
various employers, including Nexon Corp. in Korea.
